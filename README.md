# fileBox
Client Server application, which idea is to store files into server. 

Client application could be started with exe (which can be built with script in .\build directory) providing the path to directory in which 
files would be managed or using windows context menu, while application of server is working in background 
(just use right click on desired directory to execute client with specified location).
First window reqires user name, which is needed for identifying files, and also for creation of directory for specified user.
